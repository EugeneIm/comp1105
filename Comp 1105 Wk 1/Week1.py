"Question 1"
#Convert the following numbers to decimals and show your work. 
#1. 1101(2)
#2. 10101010(2)
"Question 2"
#Conver the decimals numbers 457 and 988 to the binary. You are supposed to use the algorithm for converting decimal to binary.


"Question 3"
#Consider that we only have 1 byte to remember data (1 byte is 8 bits).
#How many numbers can be represented?
#How many numbers can be represented if we have N bytes rather than 1 byte?

"Question 4"
#Use the ASCII encoding table to represent the following characters or strings in binary.
#1. 124 on the ASCII encoding table
"Column 9 Row #4, Column 0 Row #5, Column 2 Row #5"

#2. %
"Column 7 Row #3"

#3. D
"Column 8 Row #7"

"Column 7 Row #9"

"Question 5"
#Write a python program that creates a car in the terminal.

"Question 6"

print(3, 2+5, 2>5, "Test!", "!", sep=' ', end='>>')
#"sep='@'" separates all the printed numbers/strings in place of a space like a spacebar gives you
#as long as the "2+5" and "2>5" are separated by commas, the interpreter will consider them to be statments and give you the answers whether it is false, like the "2>5", and "7" from the "2+5". 
#   3@7@False@Test!@!>> is the result of the print statement above. 

#if I were to do sep=" ", the print would show as
#   3 7 False Test! !>>

#take away the "end='>>'"
#   3@7@False@Test!@!

#so on and so forth, what you take away is taken away from the end product, if I take away the "3" at the very beginning, the product would start with "7" instead of "3".
